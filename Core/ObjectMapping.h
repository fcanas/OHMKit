/**
 The OHMMappable protocol defines methods that can be used to set mapping patterns that OHMKit provides on classes.
 
 You do not need to implement any of these methods. By calling OHMMappable with your class as a parameter, that receiving class will
 always conform to OHMMappable. 
 
 @warning Subclasses of classes that are dynamically made mappable do not themselves become mappable.

 Sets the dictionary for mapping keys. 

 The key is a key you would like to map from, what might be called a source key such as @"favorite_color". The values corresponds to the KVC key you would like to map it to, what might be called a target key such as @"favoriteColor".

 @param dictionary A dictionary source key, target key pairs, all strings. The target key (or values in the dictionary) must be a KVC key the class can already respond to. OHMKit does not perform multiple key mappings.
